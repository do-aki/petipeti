The OCI8 Extension
------------------

The OCI8 extension allows PHP to access Oracle databases.  It can be
built using Oracle 9.2, 10, or 11 client libraries. It allows Oracle's
standard cross-version connectivity, for example PHP using Oracle 10.2
libraries can connect to Oracle Database 9.2 onwards.

This release of OCI8 can be used with PHP versions 4.3.9 to 5.x.
